            <p id="history-p"> Here is the story about how ONE OK ROCK rose to fame: </p>
            <div id="history-list">
                <p id="his1"> ONE OK ROCK is a Japanese rock band formed in 2005 and debuted in 2007.
                Since then, the band has grown at a fast pace with immense support by the younger generation for its emo and 
                rock-based sounds along with aggressive live performances.
                The foundation for One Ok Rock began on July 29, 2005 when Toru Yamashita, then a high school 
                student, wanted to start a band. He told his friend Ryota Kohama, a fellow member of the hip-hop 
                dance group Heads, to learn the bass and asked Alexander Onizawa, who was their senior in school 
                to join. He asked his classmate, Yu Koyanagi, to play drums
                At that time, Takahiro Moriuchi was playing with another band, 
                but Yamashita insisted that he join One Ok Rock instead. After signing 
                with Amuse, Inc. Koyanagi left the band to pursue an acting career. 
                Tomoya Kanki was a student at the ESP (Musical Academy) and was already in a band that wasn't 
                going well. He then joined One Ok Rock in 2006, and became an official member when they debuted in 
                2007. </p>

                <p id="his2"> They have rapidly become one of the most popular Japanese rock bands due to hugely successful 
                concerts such as Nippon Budokan Live in 2010, Yokohama Stadium Live in 2014, and arena tours in 2013 
                & 2015. In 2016, they held an outdoor live concert that drew an astounding 110,000 people and in 
                2018, they held a nationwide dome tour including two days at Tokyo Dome. 
                In April 2015, the band signed a worldwide distribution deal with Warner Bros and have 
                since held tours in the US, Europe, South America and Australia. </p>

                <p id="his3"> The band released the album, "Eye of the Storm" in 2019 and were chosen as the opening act for 
                Ed Sheeran's Divide Asia Tour. In October 2020, the band successfully conducted their first attempt 
                at an online live concert that was broadcast live simultaneously around the world without an audience.
                This year the band released two new singles『Renegades』and 『Broken Heart of Gold』and in July 2021, 
                they completed their first acoustic live performance, sharing a more intimate side of their music. 
                ONE OK ROCK will continue towards their goal to be Japan's first globally recognized band and in 
                turn have a strong impact on today's younger generation and the Alternative music scene as a whole. </p>
